          	 <h1>About Holly and Justin</h1>
             <p>Holly is the founder and lead designer of two business, The Little Flower 
             Soap Co and Sweet Pea Floral Design - a wedding and event floral design company in Ann 
             Arbor, MI. Holly brings a love of great design, a passion for creating small masterpieces 
             by hand and a desire to offer a refreshing, unique and memorable customer experience.</p>

			 <p>Justin is a family medicine doctor in his first year of residency with a 
             passion for herbs, vitamins, nutrition and natural health care. He develops recipes using his 
             intuition, a process similar to kinesiology. Because Justin isn’t worried about the cost of 
             ingredients his recipes can be pricy to produce and time consuming to make but are arguably the 
             best in our market.</p>
             
             <h1>What inspires us</h1>
             <p>We were inspired by the homemade gem recipes for lip balms, massage balms 
             and soaps that come and go from our local food co-ops and farmers markets. We realized we 
             could create healing ingredient loaded versions of these every day necessities for our own 
             use. I stay inspired by the the rave reviews and repeat customers that we have collected 
             over these 5 years. When I’m feeling worn thin during rush seasons like Mother’s Day and 
             Christmas I take a few minutes to read the 3500 + 5 star reviews that our sweet customers 
             have left on our Etsy shop. I love seeing people say things like “it smells AMAZING” and 
             “its my new favorite” and especially “this stuff really works!” I am inspired by nature in 
             a big way so when I'm feeling uninspired a drive to the country, or walk in the woods fixes 
             me right up. A strong cup of coffee and James Taylor's greatest hits will do the trick when 
             I can't get away.</p>

			 <h1>About our workshop</h1>
             <p>Our studio is always strewn with trays of product cooling, drying, waiting to be labeled. 
             Big candy jars full of lip balms and bakers racks full of soaps. I love our packing and 
             shipping station the best because we managed to find a vintage scale, stapler and scissors 
             that still work (they don't make 'em like they used to!) so it feels like you are in a classic 
             film ... a film about packing and shipping until you run out of boxes. Sometimes its a battle 
             ground where flowers and soaps fight for attention and space. We are looking forward to a larger studio</p>
